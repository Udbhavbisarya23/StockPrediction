Dataset creation for GCN-based Stock price prediction and for Node-embeddings based Stock prediction using corporation networks. This repository uses the relations between companies and their institutional shareholders. Using this a bipartite graph is created. We use a projection of this graph to get the final corporation network which consists of only stock nodes.

The colab notebook which implements GCN is "GCN_StockPrediction_T7.ipynb"
